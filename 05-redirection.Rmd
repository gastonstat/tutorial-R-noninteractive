## Redirection

Another way to execute R scripts in the command line is with 
the `R` command and the redirection operator `<`.

Consider the file `myscript1.R` in the `scripts/` directory.
This file generates two random vectors, fitting a regression line,
and generates two plots:

```{r regression, eval = FALSE}
# Regression analysis of two random vectors

# random data
x <- rnorm(20)
y <- x + rnorm(20)

# regression line
reg <- lm(y ~ x)

# scatter diagram with fitted regression line
png('scatterplot.png')
plot(x, y, las = 1, pch = 19, col = "#555555")
abline(reg, col = "#0000DD59", lwd = 2)
dev.off()

# residuals plot
png('residuals_plot.png')
plot(x, reg$residuals, las = 1, pch = 19, col = "#606060")
abline(h = 0)
dev.off()
```

Here's how to execute this script in the command line with a redirection 
operator:

```bash
R --vanilla < myscript1.R
```

## Passing arguments

You can also pass arguments with the `--args` options of the `R` command:

```bash
R --vanilla --args 10 5 2 < normal-vector.R
```
