## R CMD

R provides an special kind of command called `R CMD` which should be executed
from the command line. This command is an interface or wrapper to various 
__R tools__ such as processing files in R documentation format, or 
manipulating add-on packages. These tools are useful in conjunction with R, 
but not intended to be called  "directly". The main source of reference to 
know more about `R CMD` is the R manual
[An Introduction to R](https://cran.r-project.org/doc/manuals/r-release/R-intro.html)

The general form is:

```bash
R CMD command options args
```

- `command` is the name of the tool

- `options` are the command line options of `R`

- `args` refers to the arguments passed on to the `command`


Some of the relevant options for this tutorial are:

- `--save` saves data sets at the end of the R session.

- `--no-save` does not save data sets at the end of the R session.

- `--no-environ` don't read any user file to set environment variables.

- `--restore` restores `.RData` file in the directory where R was started

- `--vanilla` combines `--no-save`, `--no-environ`, `--no-site-file`, 
`--no-init-file` and `--no-restore`

- `--quiet`, `--silent`, and `-q` don't print out the initial copyright and welcome messages

- `--slave` makes R run as quietly as possible.


### R CMD BATCH

Among the several available R tools, the one that we are interested in is the
`BATCH` tool, which is designed to run R in batch mode, that is, batch
execution of R.

When you run `R CMD BATCH`, the default options are `--restore --save`

To see more information, check the manual documentation by typing
`?BATCH` (or `help(BATCH)`) from within an R interactive session. Or by 
typing `R CMD BATCH --help` from the command line.

The usage is as follows:

```bash
R CMD BATCH options infile outfile
```

- `options` are optional _options_ from the command R

- `infile` is the required input file with the code to be executed

- `outfile` is the name of an optional output file. If no output file
is provided, the name of `infile` is taken as default, appending
the extension `.Rout` to it.



## Running a script

Consider the file `myscript1.R` (inside the folder `scripts/`). 
If you take a look at its contents, this script generates two vectors `x`
and `y` of length 20. It fits a regression line (regressing `y` on `x`).
Then it produces two plots: 1) a scatterplot with the fitted regression line, 
and 2) a residual plot. Both plots are saved as png images.

To run the code inside `myscript1.R` in batch mode, you have type the
following commands from the command line:

```bash
R CMD BATCH myscript1.R
```

The file `myscript1.R` is the __input__ file.

`R CMD BATCH` generates an output file. By default, this file has the same
name as the input file, but its extension will be `.Rout`. In other words,
the output of `R CMD BATCH` always goes to a file that is built with name
of the input filename and appending `out`. For this particular example, 
the output file will be `myscript1.Rout`. However, you can provide a 
different name if you want so.

```bash
# specifying the name of the output file
R CMD BATCH myscript1.R myscript1-output.R
```

If you run the command `R CMD BATCH myscript1.R`, you should be able to 
see a file called `myscript1.Rout`. If you open this file, you will see 
the welcome message that appears every time you open a new session in R, 
followed by the R commands (i.e. R code) that were executed, and finally
an additional command at the end of the file with information
about the execution time:

Notice that the R code inside the output file is displayed with the
prompt character `>`.

`R CMD BATCH` has default options `--restore --save --no-readline`

- `--save` saves all the objects in the workspace
(i.e. all the objects created while the script was executed) into 
a hidden file `.RData` which is a file in R's binary format. When you 
save the available objects, this is known as saving the `image`
(see `help(save)` for more information).

- `--restore` will load the saved images, that is, will `load()` the
content of the file `.RData` in the directory where R was started.

- `--no-readline` turns off command-line editing via `readline`.
This option is not that important.

If you don't want `R CMD BATCH` to save the image, use the option
`--no-save`. Likewise, if you don't want `R CMD BATCH` to load the 
objects in `.RData` use `--no-restore`.

You can further modify the contents of the output file with a couple 
of additional options:

- `R CMD BATCH --silent` won't print out the initial copyright and 
welcome messages.

- `R CMD BATCH --no-save` won't save the workspace image 
(i.e. no `.RData` will be saved).

- `R CMD BATCH --vanilla` combines `--no-save`, `--no-environ`, 
`--no-site-file`, `--no-init-file` and `--no-restore`.

## Passing arguments to a script

In `script1.R`, the number of random values used to create vectors `x` and 
`y` was fixed. However, it would be nice if the user could specify a 
a value of `n` to control the length of the random numbers. In other words,
it would be nice if we could specify a value for an argument `n` that
we could pass it to the script file.

When running R scripts, often you will want to provide values for
certain arguments. Luckily, `R CMD BATCH` allows you specify arguments
and pass them to the script.

How to run an R script in batch mode and passing argument?
You can pass parameters to scripts via additional arguments on the command line.
This is done by quoting the arguments using the `--args` option:

```
R CMD BATCH "--args arg1 arg2" myscript.R 
```

To see an example, take a look at the file `myscript2.R` which is almost
identical to `myscript1.R`. The difference is that `myscript2.R` reads in 
a parameter for `n` which is the number of values to generate the x-y 
coordinates for the scatterplot.

Let's say we want to generate 50 values. Here's how to pass this number:

```bash
R CMD BATCH "--args 50" myscript2.R
```
